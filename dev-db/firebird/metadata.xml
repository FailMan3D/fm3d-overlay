		Note from FailMan3D: While my modified version of this ebuild is based
		on the official version from Gentoo's Portage tree, my version is not
		official, and will probably never be.

		I am not an expert ebuild author, and I provide no guarantee that this
		modified ebuild won't horribly damage your system.
		In a good-faith attmept to keep people from spamming the official
		ebuild's maintainers with bug reports that aren't their fault, I have
		removed their contact information from this file.
	
		If you absolutely must contact upstream's maintainers, please see the
		official ebuild's metadata.xml for up-to-date contact info.
